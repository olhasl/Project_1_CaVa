## Remarks
+ good readme
+ missing ```__str__``` method
+ code does not handle more than 24 persons
+ don't use comment instead of docstring, investigate docstrings to understand what it is
+ code is short and optimized, chatgpt or you?

## General remark
Nice project! :fire: A few things missing but I can see you worked as a team.
Try reinforcing OOP to make sure to maximize your time for the next project
